## 🔐 Security Considerations

- All data is stored **locally on your device**, encrypted at rest.  
- No external servers or APIs are used — everything runs **client-side**.  
- Encryption is derived from the user’s PIN and never leaves the device.  
- Backup exports are **encrypted**, so only your app instance (with correct PIN) can decrypt them.
